# A small prototype based on Bexio's interview

## Goal

My idea with this project was just to demonstrate a little understanding of relevant topics that were discussed in the interview. If necessary, I can evolve a little more any of the subjects.

## Topics
- Symfony structure
- Doctrine and entities
- API
- Tests
- Performance using asynchronous strategies (In progress)
- Docker/Docker-compose  (In progress)
- Command (Design Pattern) (In progress)
- Deploy on Google cloud 

## Deployment
The Prototype is working on a google cloud instance
